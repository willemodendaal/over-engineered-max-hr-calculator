# Over-Engineered-Max-HR-Calculator

Max Heart Rate calculator built on a ridiculously over-engineered technology stack.

The formula used is 205.8 – (.685 x age), proposed by Dr Jason R Karp.

## But why so complicated?!

This project is actually meant to be a boilerplate project tying a couple of technologies together. The "Max HR calculator" part of it is just to give the project some usefulness (anything other than a todo list app!)

## Technology stack

- ✓ ASP.NET Core to serve static pages and handle any server-side logic.
- ✓ React for the web front-end.
- ✓ With React Router for front-end routing. 
- With Redux on the front-end to manage state.
- ✓ Using Babel + Webpack + the latest javascript.
- Authentication with OAuth and Facebook.
- Service Workers for offline capability.
- PouchDb for offline data synchronization.
- CouchDb for server-side data storage.
- ✓ Docker to tie it all together!

## Stretch goals:
- Unit tests for Redux reducers.
- Stricter typing with Flow, TypeScript or similar technology.
