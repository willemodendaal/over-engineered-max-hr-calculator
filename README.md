# Over-Engineered-Max-HR-Calculator

Max Heart Rate calculator built on a ridiculously over-engineered technology stack.

The formula used is 205.8 â€“ (.685 x age), proposed by Dr Jason R Karp.

## But why so complicated?!

This project is actually meant to be a boilerplate project tying a couple of technologies together. The "Max HR calculator" part of it is just to give the project some usefulness (anything other than a todo list app!)

## Technology stack

- Authentication with OAuth and Facebook.
- React + Redux for the web front-end.
- Babel + Webpack + the latest javascript.
- Service Workers for offline capability.
- PouchDb for offline data synchronization.
- CouchDb for server-side data storage.
- ASP.NET Core to serve static pages and handle any server-side logic.
- Docker to tie it all together!
