				Over Engineered Max HR Calculator
			</h3>
			<p>
				Max Heart Rate calculator built on a ridiculously over-engineered technology stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				The formula used is 205.8 â€“ (.685 x age), proposed by Dr Jason R Karp.
			</p>

			<h3>
				But why so complicated?!
			</h3>
			<p>
				This project is actually meant to be a boilerplate project tying a couple of technologies together. The "Max HR calculator" part of it is just to give the project some usefulness (anything other than a todo list app!)
